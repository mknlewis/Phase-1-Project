# Phase-1-Project
Aviation Accident Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project aims to analyze aviation accident data to identify the lowest-risk aircraft models for a company planning to expand into the aviation industry. The analysis involves data cleaning, imputation, exploration, and visualization to generate actionable insights for business decision-making.

Business Understanding

The company seeks to diversify its portfolio by purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises. However, it lacks knowledge about the risks associated with different aircraft. The goal is to determine which aircraft models have the lowest accident rates and are safest for investment.

Data Understanding

Dataset Source

The dataset, obtained from the National Transportation Safety Board, covers civil aviation accidents from 1962 to 2023. It includes details on:

Aircraft make and model

Type of accident

Weather conditions

Fatalities and injuries

Year and location of incidents

Other relevant accident-related attributes

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values through imputation techniques

Standardizing column names and formats

Removing irrelevant or duplicate data

Data Analysis

Key Analysis Performed:

Accident Trends Over Time – Visualized patterns in aviation accidents across different years.

Aircraft Manufacturer Analysis – Identified manufacturers with the highest and lowest accident rates.

Weather Conditions & Accidents – Analyzed the impact of weather on accidents.

Severity of Accidents – Categorized accidents based on fatalities and injuries.

Geographical Distribution – Mapped accident locations to observe regional trends.

Visualizations

Scatter Plot of Accident Trends – Shows the distribution of accidents over time.

Bar Charts – Highlight top 10 manufacturers with most and least accidents.

Heatmaps – Represent correlations between accident severity and other variables.

Pie Charts – Illustrate proportions of accident causes.

Recommendations

Invest in Aircraft with Lower Accident Rates – Based on analysis, models from certain manufacturers show fewer accidents.

Prioritize Aircraft with Better Weather Resilience – Aircraft that perform well in diverse weather conditions should be preferred.

Safety Training & Maintenance Policies – Implement rigorous pilot training and maintenance routines to further reduce risks.

Next Steps

Enhance analysis by incorporating additional features like maintenance records.

Build a predictive model to assess aircraft accident probability.

Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time decision-making.

Conclusion

This project provides data-driven insights to assist the company in making informed investment decisions in the aviation industry. By selecting the safest aircraft models and implementing risk-mitigation strategies, the company can successfully enter the aviation sector with reduced operational risks.
